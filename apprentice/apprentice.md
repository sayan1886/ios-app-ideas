#What is it?
"A network that lets users take on apprentices for a period of time and train them right from their mobile device. Users can monetize their training services or do it for free, the power is left to them. For paid apprenticeships, the company retains a percentage of the fee."

#Why this?
Training services, especially those delivered virtually have exploded in the past 5 years. But, the best experiences are still owned by those who can personalize the learning experience. Also, for many, receiving training in a skill may be inaccessible based on cost, location, or a variety of other socioeconomic parameters. Apprenticeships provide the personalization people want while the app provides the convenience users and teachers need to make learning in today's busy world possible.

#How's it different than other similar products?
Most app-driven learning products are isolated learning experiences. At best, they included forums or chat from service representatives, but it doesn't scale to ensure the student always gets the help they need. Students want personalized guidance, students want to hear from the experts mouth, this app goes right to the heart of this request by focusing on giving the teacher the tools to deliver an incomparable learning experience to their apprentices.
