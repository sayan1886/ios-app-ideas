App Idea #1 - Table Top RPG
RPG Character Sheet/Builder, Experience Calculator, Dice Roller (start here first!), Combat Manager

features mentioned by AJ and his buddy:
- initiative track (everyone calls out their number, and then it gives the order)
    - context: before each battle, DM’s say make your initiative roll
    - depending on the roll, it will determine how aware you are during that moment and how some things will happen
    - should be easy to clear/reset
    - and you’d have the monsters initiatives too
    - top of the rounds
    - advanced: syncing of these roles in real-time
- random name generator
- conditions (dropbox of conditions) since not all DMs have nice boards like AJ
- a way to hide your dice rolls
- any of the information on AJ’s board
- traveling speeds and trivia type of knowledge that can be quickly indexed
- nice-to-haves: charts from books
- notes section from the DM
- create campaigns and have people join
